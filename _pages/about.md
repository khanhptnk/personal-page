I am postdoc researcher in the [NLP group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/) at Princeton University, mentored by Prof. [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/).

I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland--College Park, advised by Prof. [Hal Daumé III](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/). Before that, I received my Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts--Amherst, working closely with Prof. [Brendan O’Connor](http://brenocon.com/) and Prof. [Erik Learned-Miller](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/).
I also spent several summers at Microsoft Research, collaborating with the [NLP group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing) and the Reinforcement Learning groups in [Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/reinforcement-learning-redmond/) and [New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york).

Some more facts about me:
